# SDN in Python

As part of ECE50863: Computer networks system, I implemented in this project a highly simplified SDN system comprising a set of switches and a controller implemented as user level python processes. The process mimic the switches and controller, bind to distinct UDP ports, and communicate using UDP sockets. The routing algorithm was implemented using the famous Djikstra's widest path algorithm. 
</br> The image in this repo shows an example of such a network.
